            <p className='text-xl mt-20'>I am a 23-year-old graduate student who completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of the Philippines.  I am a artistic person and I earned money through commission graphic design work during nearly my entire time in engineering school. I saw some similarities when I recreate some design in photoshop and making a website following a specific design and making it's functionalities.
