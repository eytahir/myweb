            <p className='text-xl mt-20'>A 23-year-old who completed a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, I am deeply passionate about merging creativity with technical expertise.  I am known for being artistic, which manifests in my love for using editing software. This unique combination allows me to seamlessly draw parallels between photo editing and code writing. Through this, I not only enhance my technical skills but also bring a fresh and innovative perspective to problem-solving. I am excited to contribute my diverse skills and perspectives to dynamic projects, where my creativity and technical proficiency can converge for impactful results.
